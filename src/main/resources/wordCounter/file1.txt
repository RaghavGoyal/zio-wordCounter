ZIO has low-level support for concurrency using fibers.
While fibers are very powerful, they are low-level.
To improve productivity, ZIO provides high-level operations built on fibers.
When you can, you should always use high-level operations, rather than working with fibers directly.
For the sake of completeness, this section introduces both fibers and some of the high-level operations built on them.
